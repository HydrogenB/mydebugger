# Migration Plan for Project Restructuring

## Phase 1: Setup New Structure

1. Create new directory structure
2. Configure path aliases in tsconfig.json and vite.config.ts
3. Update build scripts in package.json
4. Create placeholder index files in new directories

## Phase 2: Migrate Design System

1. Move design system files to new structure
2. Update imports in design system files
3. Create index files for automatic exports
4. Update tests for design system components

## Phase 3: Migrate Features (Former Tools)

1. Create feature manifests
2. Move each tool to the features directory
3. Update imports in feature files
4. Update feature-specific tests

## Phase 4: Migrate API Routes

1. Reorganize API routes by domain
2. Create index files for API routes
3. Update API route imports

## Phase 5: Update Application Logic

1. Update App.tsx to use new routing
2. Update global contexts
3. Update global state management
4. Update utility functions

## Phase 6: Testing & Validation

1. Verify all features work correctly
2. Run all tests
3. Check build output
4. Test in development and production modes

## Migration Guidelines

- Migrate one module at a time
- Update imports as you go
- Run tests after each significant change
- Keep old structure temporarily until migration is complete
- Use search and replace for common import patterns
